# Cybersecurity Analysis Methodology for Solar Inverter Systems

## Overview

This research project implements a comprehensive cybersecurity analysis methodology for internet-connected solar inverters within distributed energy systems, specifically focused on South Australia's regulatory environment. The methodology combines multiple established cybersecurity frameworks to provide a holistic assessment of vulnerabilities, threats, and economic impacts.

## Core Analysis Frameworks

### 1. Vulnerability Analysis (CVE-Based)

**Framework**: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Database Analysis
**Purpose**: Identify known vulnerabilities in solar inverter systems and associated components

**Methodology**:
- **CVE Database Integration**: Automated querying of NIST NVD database for solar inverter manufacturers

- **Vulnerability Categorization**: Classification by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational)
- **CVSS Scoring**: Standardized vulnerability scoring using Common Vulnerability Scoring System
- **Affected Component Mapping**: Correlation of vulnerabilities to specific system components

**Outputs**:
- Vulnerability inventory with CVSS scores
- Severity distribution analysis
- Affected component mapping
- Mitigation recommendations

### 2. STRIDE Threat Modeling

**Framework**: Microsoft STRIDE Methodology
**Purpose**: Systematic identification and analysis of security threats

**STRIDE Categories**:
- **Spoofing**: Identity spoofing attacks (e.g., impersonating legitimate inverters)
- **Tampering**: Data/system modification (e.g., command injection)
- **Repudiation**: Denial of actions performed (e.g., log manipulation)
- **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized data access (e.g., sensitive configuration exposure)
- **Denial of Service**: Service availability attacks (e.g., resource exhaustion)
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Unauthorized access escalation (e.g., admin privilege bypass)

**Methodology**:
- **Component Analysis**: Systematic review of each system component
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Examination of data flows between components
- **Trust Boundary Mapping**: Identification of trust boundaries and crossing points
- **Threat Enumeration**: Comprehensive threat identification for each component and data flow
- **Risk Scoring**: Likelihood Ã— Impact calculation for each threat

**Outputs**:
- Threat inventory with risk scores
- STRIDE category distribution
- Component vulnerability summary
- Mitigation strategy recommendations

### 3. DREAD Risk Assessment

**Framework**: DREAD Risk Assessment Model
**Purpose**: Quantitative risk assessment of identified threats

**DREAD Components**:
- **Damage**: Potential damage if exploit succeeds (1-10 scale)
- **Reproducibility**: How reliably attack can be reproduced (1-10 scale)
- **Exploitability**: How easy it is to exploit (1-10 scale)
- **Affected Users**: Number of users affected (1-10 scale)
- **Discoverability**: How easy vulnerability is to discover (1-10 scale)

**Methodology**:
- **Threat Prioritization**: Ranking threats by DREAD scores
- **Risk Level Classification**: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Minimal
- **Component Analysis**: Risk assessment by affected component
- **Mitigation Prioritization**: Recommendations based on risk scores

**Outputs**:
- Prioritized threat list
- Risk distribution analysis
- Component-specific risk assessments
- Mitigation recommendations

### 4. Regulatory Compliance Analysis

**Framework**: Multi-framework compliance assessment

- **SA Solar Policy**: South Australia-specific solar energy policies
- **Cybersecurity Act**: Relevant cybersecurity legislation

**Methodology**:
- **Requirement Mapping**: Systematic mapping of regulatory requirements
- **Compliance Assessment**: Evaluation of current system compliance
- **Gap Analysis**: Identification of compliance gaps
- **Implementation Planning**: Recommendations for achieving compliance

**Outputs**:
- Compliance status report
- Gap analysis
- Implementation recommendations
- Risk assessment for non-compliance

### 5. Economic Impact Analysis

**Framework**: Comprehensive economic modeling
**Purpose**: Quantify economic consequences of cybersecurity incidents

**Analysis Components**:
- **Direct Costs**: Immediate financial impacts (lost revenue, emergency response, equipment replacement)
- **Indirect Costs**: Secondary impacts (reputation damage, regulatory penalties, insurance increases)
- **Market Impact**: Electricity spot price effects
- **Sector Analysis**: Impact on different economic sectors
- **Recovery Costs**: Costs to restore systems and operations

**Methodology**:
- **Scenario Modeling**: Analysis of different attack scenarios
- **Capacity Impact Assessment**: Evaluation of generation capacity effects
- **Price Modeling**: Spot price impact analysis using historical data
- **Sector Impact Calculation**: Economic impact by sector
- **Risk-Weighted Analysis**: Probability-weighted economic impacts
